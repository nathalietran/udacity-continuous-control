# Project context

In this project, we use the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment that contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment, in which a double-jointed arm can move to target locations.

A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

In order to solve the environment, the agents must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes and over all agents.
